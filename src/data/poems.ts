  <p>My green-eyed one, before this</p>

  <p>Eyed one whose gaze is endless, grasping</p>
  <p>Eternity in a lifetime.</p>
  <p>inheriting ancestral DNA</p>
  <p>Baked on Parchment—its imitations</p>
  <p>or otherwise, remember I,</p>
  <p>My late-evening sunrise.</p>
  <p>My mysteries created for you</p>
  <p>Out of wonder, my green-eyed</p>
  <p>One, bask in luster and brilliance;</p>
  <p>Constellations of your starry skies shine</p>
  <p>Like pina coladas served at the edge</p>
  <p>Of the universe.</p>
  <p>My green-eyed one, whose eyes</p>
  <p>have me melt, like popsicles</p>
  <p>on the fourth of July,</p>
  <p>whose jasmine tea skin</p>
  <p>brings warmth to my soul.</p>
  <p>It's you, I wish to know</p>
  <p>And your secret day-dreams,</p>
  <p>Dreamt amongst the droning</p>

  <p>But today is different. The oven reflects a magical light that makes her feel</p>
  <p>alive. She connects with every note from the piano and the waterfall of sounds</p>

  <p>Today, for an unknown reason, the girl notices the room and the room is</p>

  <div class="stanza">
  <p>The sun cycles to visit once a day</p>
  <p>As I sit there pondering about my next lay</p>
  <p>I yearn for the feeling of someone's skin against my lips</p>
  <p>But there's this recurring memory of my monster's bruising grips</p>
  <p>I toss and turn in bed hoping to get some sleep for once—</p>
  <p>Only to be awakened by the nightmare of this foolish dunce</p>
  <p>He appears out of nowhere without a care in the world for what he's done,</p>
  <p>And so I scavenge through my closet to try to find my gun</p>
  <p>I point it hesitantly against his manipulative beating heart,</p>
  <p>And tears run quickly down my face as my heart falls apart</p>
  <p>His evil grin widens for he knows I won't do much</p>
  <p>Because he knows he has me around his finger - he knows he's my crutch</p>
  <p>And so instead of pulling the trigger, I point it to my heart instead</p>
  <p>And soon enough, I would be bleeding right there on my deathbed</p>
  <p>The next scene is eerily quiet and saddening indeed,</p>
  <p>But he got what he wanted—to happily watch me bleed</p>
  <p>The moon now shines as it looks over the mess I've now made</p>
  <p>Yet he still stands over me unbothered, undismayed</p>
