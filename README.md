# Poetry Pond

This is a pond of poems. Open to submissions, I hope to create a database of poem from many local, community artist and poets. Feel free to share and [submit](https://forms.gle/Z29qCKZjbts18DfT7) your own work! 

This is still in development, but ideally, there will be sounds, search filters, and more objects in the pond.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

Thank you!
